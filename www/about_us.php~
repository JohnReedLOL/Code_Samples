<!--Hello there. We are Anonymous and in the spirit of 
this site we will say nothing about our identities.
 That being said, let us talk about Anon. -->

<br><br>
<h2 class="SecondHeader"> <u> Anonymity Explained: </u> </h2>
Anon is an anonymous digital world. 
Originally born as a simple message board, Anon has grown and 
developed into a powerhouse of anonymity. All aspects of Anonymous 
World are seperate, anonymous, and distinct entities, guaranteeing 
super anonymity.  Additonally, the file upload feature allows
users to share content anonymously. Keep in mind, uploading files presents
a chance to clear all previously uploaded content. Finally, more socially
involved users possess the ability to rank up through interactions and increasing
followers. The live chat, message board, and MMORPG world 
all use seperate and distinct anonymous profiles to guarantee 
your privacy and security.

<br><br>
There are many ways of guaranteeing anonymity. All 
 posts are limited in scope and automatically deleted with time. 
 Before they can become too popular, they are destroyed. Whether 
 after five views, ten views, or a hundred views, you set your 
 view limit, and the post is destroyed. In the anonymous online 
 game, each login creates a new, anonymous name. The chat logs
 delete with time. It is a world where people can be themselves.
 It is a world of the anonymous.

<h2 class="SecondHeader"> <u> Ranking System: </u> </h2>
<br><br>    

Rank distinguishes the user based on how many followers he or she has.<br> 
The rank hierarchy is as follows:<br><br>
Neophyte:  followers < 5<br>
Adherent:  followers < 10<br>
Speaker:   followers < 20<br>
Listener:  followers < 30<br>
Harbinger: followers < 40<br>
